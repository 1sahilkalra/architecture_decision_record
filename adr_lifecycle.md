# ADR Lifecycle

1. Decision identification

  * How urgent and how important is the AD?
  * Does it have to be made now, or can it wait until more is known?
  * Both personal and collective experience, as well as recognized design methods and practices, can assist with decision identification.
  * Ideally maintain a decision todo list that complements the product todo list.

2. Decision making

  * A number of decision making technqiues exists, both general ones and software and software architecture specific ones, for instance, dialogue mapping.[15] Group decision making is an active research topic.

3. Decision documentation

  * Many templates and tools for decisison capturing exist, both in agile communities (e.g., M. Nygard's ADRs) and in traditional software engineering and architecture design processes (e.g., see table layouts suggested by IBM UMF and by Tyree and Akerman from CapitalOne.

4. Decision enactment and enforcement

  * ADs are used in software design; hence they have to be communicated to, and accepted by, the stakeholders of the system that fund, deveop, and operate it. Architecturally evident coding styles [19] and code reviews that focus on architectural concerns and decisions are two related practices. ADs also have to be (re-)considered when modernizing a software sytem in software evolution.

5. Decision sharing (optional)

  * Many ADs recur across projects; hence, experiences with past decisions, both good and bad, can be valuable reusable assets when employing an explicit knowledge management strategy.
